# Biography

I am a research associate in the Systems Research Group. I have recently completed my PhD in Computer Science in the Systems Research Group at the University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Technology. During my PhD I was a Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher working in the EU-funded METRICS project. I studied for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, where I graduated first of my class, and for my master degree in Computer Science at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I am an alumna of Churchill College. I served as postgraduate representative and media chair on the women@CL committee for the academic years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. I was awarded a Women Techmakers Scholarship by Google in 2017.

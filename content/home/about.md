# Biography

I am a final year PhD student in Computer Science and a Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher in the Systems Research Group at the University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory, and my advisor is Dr. Andrew Moore. I am interested in data centre networking, network measurement and programmable data planes.

I studied for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, where I graduated first of my class, and for my master degree in Computer Science at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

I am a member of Churchill College. I served as postgraduate representative and media chair on the women@CL committee for the academic years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. I was awarded a Women Techmakers Scholarship by Google in 2017.
